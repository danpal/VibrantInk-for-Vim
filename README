This is an exact copy of the VibrantInk theme for textmate made
for Vim. Is not the same as vividchalk, in the sense that this one
is not based on VibrantInk, but its exactly like VibrantInk.
Also the vibrantink.vim that comes with Color Sampler is quite 
off the real vibrantink theme.


INSTALLATION:

Simply download vibrantink.vim to ~/.vim/colors/


If you want to track it and already have other colors, for example if you installed janus vim or Vim Color Sampler then:
do:

mv ~/.vim/colors/vibrantink.vim vibrantink-old.vim
git clone --no-checkout git@github.com:danpal/VibrantInk-for-Vim.git ~/.vim/colors/colors.tmp
mv ~/.vim/colors/colors.tmp/.git ~/.vim/colors/
rm -rf ~/.vim/colors/colors.tmp/
cd ~/.vim/colors/
git reset --hard HEAD
